# Contributing to fzf-eip üîç ‚ô¢

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Workflow

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

All code changes happen through pull requests. They are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Issue that pull request!
3. Review notes from team and update PR accordingly
4. Once PR has been approved, the branch is deleted.
5. For more info see the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

## Contributions and License

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting Bugs

Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/cds-amal/fzf-eip/issues).

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cds-amal/fzf-eip/issues). It's super easy!

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample command/code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
