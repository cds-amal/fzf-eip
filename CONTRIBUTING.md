# Contributing to fzf-eip üîç ‚ô¢

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Workflow

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

All code changes happen through pull requests. They are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Issue that pull request!
3. Review notes from team and update PR accordingly
4. Once PR has been approved, the branch is deleted.
5. For more info see the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

## Contributions and License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting Bugs

Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/cds-amal/fzf-eip/issues).

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cds-amal/fzf-eip/issues). It's super easy!

### Bug reports format

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report written by someone else. We also think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), another app developer.

### Summary of Great Bug Reports

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [A stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We are borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Tools to enforce consistent style to be determined.
